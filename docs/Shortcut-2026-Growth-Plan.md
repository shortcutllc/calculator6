---

### CUSTOMER BASE

| Metric | 2025 |
|--------|------|
| Unique clients served | 35 |
| Clients at $10K+ annual spend | 15 |

#### Top Accounts

| Client | 2025 Revenue |
|--------|--------------|
| DraftKings LV | $115,200 |
| Betterment | $31,190 |
| DraftKings NY | $29,908 |
| BCG NYC | $26,725 |
| Celonis | $23,895 |

| Wachtell Lipton | $11,730 |
| BCG Seattle | $11,411 |

**Pattern:** Multi-location expansion (BCG 4 cities, DraftKings 3 locations) is working.

---

### 2025 CHALLENGES

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Missed $1M exit goal | Ended at $825K run rate vs $1M target |
| Slow partner acquisition | Net-new recurring partners didn't compound quickly enough |
| Revenue quality | Some growth was one-time events vs recurring contracts |
| Visibility gaps | Revenue timing made forecasting difficult |
| Concentration risk | DraftKings LV = 15%+ of gross revenue |

**Key insight:** These are go-to-market tuning issues, not product or execution failures. The model works.

---

### THE 2026 QUESTION

The story is no longer "can this work?"

**It's how quickly Shortcut compounds what already works.**

---

## SECTION 2: 2026 STRATEGY

---

### THE FOUR GROWTH LEVERS

| Lever | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| 1. Content | Lower the education barrier for new clients |
| 2. Conferences | Accelerate qualified leads at national + local level |
| 3. Healthcare Channels | Unlock employer wellness dollars (Cigna, Aetna, BCBS) |
| 4. Hosted Events | Build our own lead-gen machine in NYC |

---

## SECTION 3: LEVER 1 — CONTENT STRATEGY

### THE PROBLEM

Most prospects have never bought this category. They don't know:

- What "corporate wellness services" actually means in practice
- How it differs from digital perks (apps, stipends)
- What quality looks like
- How to justify the spend internally

**We're selling something they didn't know they needed. That's an education problem, not a sales problem.**

---

### CONTENT WE NEED

#### Awareness Stage — "What is this?"

| Asset | Purpose | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| "The In-Person Wellness Playbook" | Define the category. Position Shortcut as the authority. | PDF guide / landing page |
| "Why Digital Perks Aren't Working" | Challenge the status quo (apps, stipends with low usage). | Blog post / LinkedIn article |
| "What Happens When Shortcut Shows Up" | Visual, visceral — show the experience. | 60-90 sec video, photo gallery |
| Client testimonial clips | Social proof from recognizable logos. | 30-sec video snippets |

#### Consideration Stage — "How does it work?"

| Asset | Purpose | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| "The HR Leader's Buying Guide" | Walk through procurement, budgeting, internal sell. | PDF / interactive guide |
| "How BCG Runs Wellness Across 4 Offices" | Case study showing multi-location model. | Written case study + video |
| "What to Expect: Your First Shortcut Event" | Reduce uncertainty. Show the process. | Email sequence / landing page |
| ROI Calculator | Let them build their own business case. | Interactive web tool |

#### Decision Stage — "Why Shortcut?"

| Asset | Purpose | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| "Single Vendor vs. Vendor Sprawl" | Competitive positioning. | Comparison one-pager |
| Service menu + pricing transparency | Remove friction. | PDF / web page |
| "Ask Us Anything" recorded Q&A | Address objections preemptively. | Video / podcast format |

---

### DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

| Channel | Content Type | Frequency |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| LinkedIn (company + personal) | Thought leadership, client wins, behind-the-scenes | 3-5x/week |
| Email newsletter | Curated insights for HR/Workplace leaders | Bi-weekly |
| Website / SEO | Evergreen guides, case studies | Ongoing |
| Conference follow-up | Targeted content based on conversation | Event-driven |

---

## SECTION 4: LEVER 2 — CONFERENCE STRATEGY

### BUDGET CONTEXT

| Half | Budget | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| H1 | $30K | 3 conferences |
| H2 | $30K | 3 conferences |

---

### LEAD ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY

#### How We Calculate Expected Leads

| Variable | Assumption |
|----------|------------|
| Attendees in target persona | 30-50% of total (HR, Benefits, Workplace Exp) |
| Booth traffic rate | 10-15% of relevant attendees visit a given booth |
| Conversation-to-lead conversion | 50-70% of booth conversations = qualified lead |
| Speaking/session bonus | +20-30% leads if you have a speaking slot |

#### Example: Workhuman (3,000 attendees)
- Target personas: ~60% = 1,800 relevant
- Booth traffic: 10% = 180 visits
- Qualified: 60% = ~108 leads at top end
- Conservative (no speaking slot): 20-30 leads

#### Example: Wellbeing at Work NYC (500 attendees)
- Target personas: ~80% = 400 relevant (highly curated)
- Booth/networking capture: 15% = 60 conversations
- Qualified: 70% = ~40 leads at top end
- Conservative: 15-25 leads

#### Factors That Increase Leads

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Speaking slot | +50-100% |
| Sponsored session/workshop | +30% |
| Pre-conference outreach list | +20% |
| On-site activation (demo services) | +25% |

### TOP 3 NATIONAL — DETAILED REASONING

#### #1: Wellbeing at Work Summit (March 3-5, NYC + Austin)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Senior HR, Wellness, Reward leaders — self-selected for this topic |
| Location | NYC. Home turf. No travel cost. Easy to activate your network. |
| Size | Intimate (500ish). You can meet everyone who matters. |
| Theme Alignment | Literally called "Wellbeing at Work." |
| Timing | Early March — sets up Q1/Q2 pipeline. |
| Cost | Lower than big nationals. Better ROI math. |

**Verdict:** No-brainer for H1. Lowest friction, highest alignment, home field advantage.

#### #2: Workhuman Live (April 27-30, Orlando)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Employee Experience, Culture, Engagement leaders — exactly who buys Shortcut |
| Theme Alignment | Conference is about human-centered workplace strategies. Wellbeing is a core track. |
| Attendee Intent | People actively investing in employee experience. Not tire-kickers. |
| Competition | Fewer wellness vendors than SHRM. Less noise. |
| Vibe | High-energy, values-driven. Matches Shortcut's brand. |
| ROI Potential | Mid-size (3K) means you can actually connect. Not lost in 25K crowd. |

**Verdict:** Best audience-to-noise ratio of any national conference. If you do one national, do this one.

#### #3: Total Rewards (WorldatWork) (April 19-22, San Antonio)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Compensation & Benefits professionals — the people who control wellness budgets |
| Theme Alignment | Total rewards = salary + benefits + perks + wellness. You're a line item they manage. |
| Buyer Type | Budget holders. They sign checks. |
| Strategic Angle | Position Shortcut as a benefit not an expense. |
| Timing | Late April — good for H1 pipeline that closes Q2/Q3. |

**Verdict:** Workhuman gets you the "culture champion." Total Rewards gets you the "budget holder." You need both.

---

### CONFERENCES NOT RECOMMENDED — REASONING

#### GCUC (April 13-16, NYC) — SKIP

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Coworking space operators, landlords, flex workspace consultants |
| Buyer Fit | ⭐ (1/5) — Wrong audience. These aren't corporate HR buyers. |
| ROI Potential | ⭐ (1/5) — Only relevant if selling B2B2C through coworking spaces. |

**Verdict:** Skip. Not your buyer.

#### ATD International (May 17-20, LA) — TIER 2

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | CLOs, L&D Directors, Training Managers |
| Size | 10,000-13,000 attendees, 400+ exhibitors |
| Buyer Fit | ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) — L&D increasingly owns wellbeing, but not primary buyers |
| Cost | $15-25K (expensive) |
| Location | LA — covers West Coast market |

**Verdict:** Consider if breaking into West Coast enterprise. Position as "talent development" not just "wellness."

National-caliber event on home turf. See national section above.

#### #2: Conference Board Employee Health Care (March 17-18, Marriott Marquis)

---

### RECOMMENDED H1 CONFERENCE PLAN

| Event | Date | Est. Cost | Expected Leads |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Wellbeing at Work NYC | March 3-5 | $5K | 15-25 |
| Conference Board NYC | March 17-18 | $5K | 10-20 |
| Workhuman Live (Orlando) | April 27-30 | $12K (incl. travel) | 20-30 |
| **Total** | | **$22K** | **45-75 qualified leads** |

Leaves $8K buffer for From Day One or opportunistic local events.

---

## SECTION 5: LEVER 3 — HEALTHCARE CHANNELS

### THE OPPORTUNITY

Companies increasingly fund wellness through employer-level healthcare budgets:

- Health Improvement Funds (Cigna)
- Wellness credits/packages (Aetna, BCBS)
- Lifestyle Spending Accounts (LSAs)

**This is NOT individual HSA/FSA. This is pooled corporate money that HR can use to pay for Shortcut services.**

---

### CIGNA HEALTH IMPROVEMENT FUND — THE MODEL

#### What It Is
Company-level wellness budget provided by Cigna to employer clients. Pooled corporate money for wellness programming.

#### How It Works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Health Engagement team meets with employer to personalize strategy and review eligible expenses |
| 2 | Employer discusses expense requests with Health Engagement team to confirm eligibility BEFORE spending |
| 3 | Employer makes purchase, submits invoices/receipts to Health Engagement team |
| 4 | Cigna reimburses the employer |

#### Key Details
- Funds available throughout plan year
- Use-it-or-lose-it — unused funds forfeited at year end
- Receipts due by end of month of purchase
- 45-60 days reimbursement processing
- Subject to local market guidelines and policy renewal

#### What's Eligible

**✅ ELIGIBLE — Shortcut Services Fit Here:**

| Cigna Category | Shortcut Service |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Activities and challenges to promote healthy living" | Wellness days, mindfulness workshops |
| "Guest speakers who discuss health and wellness topics" | Mindfulness facilitators |
| "Onsite group exercise classes (e.g. Zumba, yoga, pilates)" | Mindfulness workshops |
| "Health Awareness Day material" | Wellness event programming |

**⚠️ POSITION CAREFULLY:**
- Chair massage → Part of "wellness activities/events"
- Grooming services → Part of "Employee Appreciation Wellness Day"
- Headshots → Part of "Health Awareness Day" package

**❌ INELIGIBLE:**
- Capital expenses (equipment, furniture)
- Gifts to individual employees
- Meals for select groups

#### The Shortcut Play
Package services as "wellness events" — not standalone massage or grooming:
- "Employee Appreciation Wellness Day"
- "Health Awareness Event"
- "Stress Reduction Program"

This framing aligns with Cigna's eligible expense language.

---

### HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TARGET LIST — RANKED

| Rank | Insurer | Program Name | Company-Level Budget? | Shortcut Services Eligible? | Contact Point |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Cigna | Health Improvement Fund | ✅ Yes | ✅ Confirmed (see above) | Health Engagement Consultants |
| 2 | BCBS TX/IL/OK | Wellbeing Network | ✅ Yes | ✅ Explicitly lists massage | Regional wellness team |
| 3 | Aetna | Premier Wellness Package | ✅ Yes | ✅ Group events eligible | SupplierEngagement@CVSHealth.com |
| 4 | UnitedHealthcare | UHC Hub | ✅ Yes (self-funded) | ⚠️ Requires vendor network | UHC Hub business development |
| 5 | Anthem/Elevance | Wellbeing Solutions | ✅ Yes (tiered) | ⚠️ Preventive focus | Ariba Network registration |
| 6 | BCBS Michigan | Well-Being Programs | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not explicit on massage | Regional contact |
| 7 | Kaiser | Fit Rewards | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Fitness focus | Lower priority |

---

### HOW TO BECOME AN APPROVED INSURER VENDOR

#### The Reality
Most wellness vendors do NOT have direct insurer contracts. Typical paths:

1. **Employer direct** — Sell to HR, they use their wellness budget ← *Fastest*
2. **Benefits broker referral** — Brokers recommend you ← *High leverage*
3. **LSA platform listing** — Employees use wellness stipends ← *Growing fast*
4. **Direct insurer vendor network** — Hardest but highest leverage ← *Long-term*

#### Direct Insurer Registration Portals

| Insurer | Portal | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Cigna | cigna.supplierone.co | Code: "CignaSupplier2". Info kept 2 years. |
| Aetna/CVS | cvshealth.supplierone.co | Email: SupplierEngagement@CVSHealth.com |
| Elevance (Anthem) | Ariba Network via elevancehealth.com | Free Ariba account required |
| UnitedHealthcare | No public portal | Contact UHC Hub team directly |
| BCBS | Varies by region | Contact regional plan |

#### Requirements to Qualify

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| General Liability Insurance | $1-2M per occurrence |
| Professional Liability (E&O) | $1M minimum |
| Workers' Comp | State-required |
| HIPAA Compliance | Documented policies |
| Background Checks | All on-site staff |
| References | 3+ similar employer clients |

---

### WHO TO TARGET WITHIN INSURERS

#### Primary Targets

| Title | Why They Matter |
|-------|-----------------|
| Health Engagement Consultant | Works directly with employer accounts. The person in Cigna's one-pager. |
| Director of Wellness Programs | Owns the wellness product offering. |
| VP of Health Engagement | Executive sponsor for wellness initiatives. |
| Vendor Relations Manager | Handles vendor onboarding and contracts. |

#### How to Find Them
LinkedIn search:
- "Health Engagement Cigna"
- "Wellness Programs Director Aetna"
- "Vendor Management UnitedHealthcare"

#### The Outreach Angle
Don't lead with "can we be a vendor?"

**Better:**
> "We work with companies like BCG, DraftKings, and Betterment to deliver on-site wellness experiences. Several of our clients are Cigna customers using their Health Improvement Fund to pay for our services. We'd love to understand how we can make it easier for Cigna employers to work with us."

Positions you as already in the ecosystem.

---

### BENEFITS BROKER/CONSULTANT TARGETS

| Firm | Focus | Why Target |
|------|-------|------------|

| USI | Mid-market | Extensive wellness vendor networks. |
| Mercer | Enterprise | Gold standard. Workplace Health practice. |
| WTW | Enterprise | "Integrated Wellbeing Solution" team. |
| Aon | Enterprise | Health Solutions practice. |

#### Broker Value Prop
> "90% of your clients don't have decent wellness programming. We can help you fill that gap — and you get the credit for bringing them a solution."

#### Event to Target
**BenefitsPRO Broker Expo** — April 28-30, Chicago
- 700+ benefits brokers and advisors
- 8.5 hours dedicated networking
- Good if pursuing broker channel seriously

---

### LSA PLATFORM TARGETS

| Platform | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Forma | Powers LSAs for Stripe, Zoom, Coinbase. 300+ companies. |
| Benepass | Card-first approach. Employees pay directly. |
| Compt | Employee stipend software. |
| Espresa | LSA administration with marketplace. |

**Action:** Apply to become a vendor on each platform. Opens access to employees at hundreds of companies without direct sales.

## SECTION 6: LEVER 3B — CLE FOR LAWYERS

### THE OPPORTUNITY

Law firms are a natural fit:
- High stress, burnout epidemic (28% depression, 21% problem drinking — ABA data)
- Concentrated decision-making (managing partners, firm administrators)
- High willingness to pay for quality
- Already a Shortcut strength (Wachtell Lipton is a client)

---

### CLE REQUIREMENTS BY STATE

9+ states now require or accept mental health/wellness CLE credits:

| State | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Florida | 5 hours / 3 years (mandatory) |
| Illinois | 1 hour / 2 years (mandatory) |
| New York | Wellness counts toward competence credits |
| California | 1 hour "Wellness Competence" eligible |
| Texas | Counts toward ethics requirement |
| Iowa | 1 hour mandatory (wellness or D&I) |
| Oregon | 1 hour per 3-year cycle |
| Minnesota | 1 hour mandatory |
| Vermont | 1 hour mandatory |

---

### IMPORTANT: MASSAGE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR CLE

**Research conclusion:** Massage does NOT qualify for CLE credits in any US state.

States like Georgia explicitly exclude physical wellness activities:
> "The Commission may not approve CLEs primarily devoted to activities such as meditation, journaling, yoga, nutrition, physical fitness or other similar activities."

**What qualifies:** Educational content about wellness (lectures, workshops, discussions) — not receiving wellness services.

---

### THE SHORTCUT CLE PLAY

**Mindfulness workshops qualify for CLE. Massage does not.**

But you can bundle:

| Component | CLE Credit? | Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Mindfulness workshop (60-90 min) | ✅ Yes (1-1.5 credits) | Continuing education |
| Chair massage (during breaks) | ❌ No | Experiential differentiation |
| Headshots (optional) | ❌ No | Practical takeaway |

**Positioning:** "CLE-accredited wellness day — mindfulness training that counts toward CLE, plus chair massage and headshots to make it memorable."

The CLE credit gets you in the door. The services make you unforgettable.

---

### CLE PRODUCT SUITE

| Product | Format | CLE Credits | Includes | Price Point |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Mindfulness CLE Session | 60-90 min workshop | 1-1.5 | Education only | $3-5K |
| Wellness Half-Day | 3-4 hours | 2-3 | CLE + massage | $8-12K |
| Wellness Full-Day | 6 hours | 4-5 | CLE + massage + headshots | $15-20K |
| Annual Program | Quarterly sessions | 4-6/year | All services | $40-60K |

---

### PATH TO MARKET

1. Get CLE accreditation in NY, CA, FL, IL, TX (apply to each state bar — 45-60 day process)
2. Partner with bar associations for distribution (NYC Bar, state bars)
3. Target Am Law 200 firms with existing wellness budgets
4. Pilot with Wachtell or similar existing client
5. Bundle with existing services

---

### REVENUE POTENTIAL

| Scenario | Math | Revenue |
|----------|------|---------|
| Conservative | 10 firms × $10K/year | $100K |
| Moderate | 25 firms × $15K/year | $375K |
| Aggressive | 50 firms × $15K/year | $750K |

---

## SECTION 7: LEVER 4 — SHORTCUT-HOSTED EVENTS

### THE CONCEPT

Instead of only attending other people's conferences, we host our own. Small, curated networking events for target buyers — with Shortcut services embedded.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS

| Reason | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| We control the room | Only qualified buyers, no noise |
| Experience IS the pitch | They feel what we do, don't just hear about it |
| Lower CAC | $5K event vs $15K conference booth |
| Content engine | Photos, testimonials, relationships from every event |
| Referral flywheel | Attendees invite peers to future events |

---

### EVENT FORMAT: "THE SHORTCUT SESSIONS"

**Concept:** Quarterly evening events for HR, Workplace Experience, and People leaders in NYC. Part networking, part wellness experience, part thought leadership.

#### Run of Show (2.5-3 hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00-6:30 | Arrival, drinks, networking |
| 6:30-7:00 | Short panel or fireside chat (client + industry speaker) |
| 7:00-8:00 | Wellness stations rotate (chair massage, express manicures, headshot booth) |
| 8:00-8:30 | Open networking, dessert |

---

### WHAT MAKES IT ATTRACTIVE

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Curated guest list | Exclusivity signals quality |
| Free high-value services | Chair massage + headshots = $200+ value |
| Peer networking | HR leaders want to meet other HR leaders |
