| Total Gross Revenue | $752,103 |
| Year-over-Year Growth | +19% |
| Exit Run Rate (Q4 pace) | $825K |

---

### CUSTOMER BASE

| Metric | 2025 |
|--------|------|
| Unique clients served | 35 |
| Clients at $10K+ annual spend | 15 |

#### Top Accounts

| Client | 2025 Revenue |
|--------|--------------|
| DraftKings LV | $115,200 |
| Betterment | $31,190 |
| DraftKings NY | $29,908 |
| BCG NYC | $26,725 |
| Celonis | $23,895 |
| BCG Boston | $20,880 |
| Cencora | $19,105 |

| Teads | $13,480 |
| BCG LA | $12,285 |
| Wachtell Lipton | $11,730 |
| BCG Seattle | $11,411 |

**Pattern:** Multi-location expansion (BCG 4 cities, DraftKings 3 locations) is working.

---

### 2025 CHALLENGES

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Missed $1M exit goal | Ended at $825K run rate vs $1M target |
| Slow partner acquisition | Net-new recurring partners didn't compound quickly enough |
| Revenue quality | Some growth was one-time events vs recurring contracts |
| Visibility gaps | Revenue timing made forecasting difficult |
| Concentration risk | DraftKings LV = 15%+ of gross revenue |

**Key insight:** These are go-to-market tuning issues, not product or execution failures. The model works.

---

### THE 2026 QUESTION

The story is no longer "can this work?"

**It's how quickly Shortcut compounds what already works.**

---

## SECTION 2: 2026 STRATEGY

---

### THE FOUR GROWTH LEVERS

| Lever | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| 1. Content | Lower the education barrier for new clients |
| 2. Conferences | Accelerate qualified leads at national + local level |
| 3. Healthcare Channels | Unlock employer wellness dollars (Cigna, Aetna, BCBS) |
| 4. Hosted Events | Build our own lead-gen machine in NYC |

---

## SECTION 3: LEVER 1 — CONTENT STRATEGY

**Happiness-First. Proof-Driven. Sales-Accelerating.**

---

### HOW WE THINK ABOUT CONTENT AT SHORTCUT

Shortcut is not selling "wellness programs."

We're selling **feel-good moments that make work better** — for employees *and* for the people responsible for them.

Most buyers:
- Have never purchased this category
- Don't know what "good" looks like
- Worry about effort, chaos, and risk
- Are unsure whether employees will actually care

This creates an education gap — but more importantly, a **confidence gap**.

Shortcut's content strategy exists to:
- Make the experience immediately understandable
- Make the value feel obvious
- Make the effort feel minimal
- Make the decision feel safe

The goal is not content volume.
The goal is **shorter sales cycles and faster "yes" decisions**.

---

### OUR VOICE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Shortcut's content should always feel:

- Light, human, and optimistic
- Happiness-forward, not heavy "wellness" language
- Confident without being salesy
- Simple, not corporate
- Reassuring, not instructional

We are **not** trying to sound like:
- A benefits provider
- A wellness consultant
- A mental health platform

We **are** trying to sound like:

> *The easiest, happiest decision an HR or Workplace leader can make.*

---

### WHAT CONTENT MUST DO

Every piece of content should quickly answer at least one of these questions:

1. **What does this actually look and feel like?**
2. **Why is this easier and better than other options?**
3. **Can I trust this to work at my company — and scale?**

If content doesn't help answer one of these, it's not a priority.

---

### THE THREE CONTENT PILLARS

#### Pillar 1: Make the Happiness Visible

Buyers need to *see* the experience to believe it.

This means:
- Real events
- Real offices
- Real employees
- Real reactions

Not polished commercials — credible, human proof.

**Outcome:** Removes imagination risk. Shrinks hesitation.

---

#### Pillar 2: Make the Ease Undeniable

HR doesn't fear cost — they fear complexity.

Content must clearly show:
- How little work HR actually does
- How signups work
- How execution runs smoothly
- How issues are handled
- How scale happens without friction

**Outcome:** Replaces "this might be work" with "this feels handled."

---

#### Pillar 3: Make the Difference Obvious

Shortcut wins because we are:
- All-in-one
- Operationally excellent
- Consistent
- Scalable
- Hospitality-driven
- Tech-enabled

This differentiation must be **explicit**, not implied.

**Outcome:** Buyers stop comparing vendors and start choosing Shortcut.

---

### THE 10 CONTENT ASSETS THAT MATTER MOST

This is the full 2026 priority list. Anything not on this list is secondary.

| # | Asset | Purpose | Stage |
|---|-------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Real Event Recap Videos | Visual proof of happiness (30-60 sec, iPhone fine) | Awareness → Decision |
| 2 | "What Happens When Shortcut Shows Up" Visual Page | Remove uncertainty (photos + clips, event timeline) | Awareness → Consideration |
| 3 | Employee Reaction Clips | Emotional validation ("This made my day") | Awareness |
| 4 | HR / Manager Testimonials (Ease-Focused) | Risk reduction ("We didn't lift a finger") | Consideration → Decision |
| 5 | All-in-One vs Vendor Sprawl One-Pager | Differentiation (one partner, one platform, one invoice) | Decision |
| 6 | "How Scaling Works" Explainer | Enterprise confidence (one → multiple offices) | Consideration → Decision |
| 7 | Multi-Location Case Study (BCG / DraftKings) | Proof of scale (rollout, consistency, scale focus) | Decision |
| 8 | Signup & Admin Flow Visuals | Ease + tech credibility (screenshots, screen recordings) | Consideration |
| 9 | "Why Companies Renew Year After Year" Page | Long-term trust (retention stats, quotes) | Decision |
| 10 | Event Experience Photo Library | Sales acceleration (clean, categorized visuals) | All stages |

---

---

### H1 VS H2 FOCUS

#### H1 2026 — Must Ship
- Event recap videos
- Visual experience page
- HR testimonials
- Vendor sprawl comparison
- Signup flow visuals

#### H2 2026 — Expansion Content
- Multi-location case study
- Scaling explainer
- Renewal proof page
- Enterprise-focused testimonials

---

### HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS

Content is successful if:
- Sales calls get shorter
- Fewer questions are asked
- Buyers say "this feels easy"
- Buyers reference content unprompted
- Time-to-yes decreases

If content doesn't do that, it doesn't matter.

---

### BOTTOM LINE

Shortcut's content strategy is about **confidence**, not education.

We show:
- What it feels like
- Why it works better
- How easy it is
- How well it scales

When buyers can *see* happiness and *trust* the process, decisions happen faster.

---

## SECTION 4: LEVER 2 — CONFERENCE STRATEGY (REVISED)

### STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

Conferences are a high-leverage channel for Shortcut — but only if we treat them as a **sales + marketing + brand play**, not just a booth exercise.

The 2026 conference strategy is structured around two halves of the year with different objectives:

| Half | Objective | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| H1 | Pipeline Creation | Meet buyers early in their fiscal year. Build relationships. |
| H2 | Budget Capture | Re-engage leads when budgets finalize. Close deals. |

---

### BUDGET CONTEXT

| Half | Budget | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| H1 | ~$33K | 3 conferences |
| H2 | ~$36K | 4 conferences |
| **Total** | **~$60K** | **7 conferences** |

*Note: Budgets are flexible. If H1 results are strong, we may shift $5-10K from H2 to double down on what's working.*

---

### H1 CONFERENCE PLAN (JAN–JUNE)

#### Objective: Pipeline Creation

H1 is about **meeting buyers early**, before they've locked in their wellness vendors for the year. The goal is to:
- Generate 50+ qualified leads
- Book 20+ demos
- Build brand awareness in key markets

#### H1 Conferences

| # | Conference | Date | Location | Est. Cost | Expected Leads | Priority |
|---|------------|------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Wellbeing at Work Summit | March 3-5 | NYC | $5K | 15-25 | **#1** |
| 2 | Total Rewards (WorldatWork) | April 19-22 | San Antonio | $20K | 20-30 | **#2** |
| 3 | Workhuman Live | April 28-May 1 | Austin | $8K | 15-25 | **#3** |
| | **H1 Total** | | | **~$33K** | **50-80** | |

#### H1 Conference Details

**1. Wellbeing at Work Summit (March 3-5, NYC) — $5K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Senior HR, Wellness, Reward leaders — self-selected for this topic |
| Location | NYC. Home turf. No travel cost. Easy to activate your network. |
| Size | Intimate (500ish). You can meet everyone who matters. |
| Theme Alignment | Literally called "Wellbeing at Work." |
| Timing | Early March — sets up Q1/Q2 pipeline. |

**Why it's #1:** Lowest friction, highest alignment, home field advantage. If we can only do one conference, this is it.

**2. Total Rewards (WorldatWork) (April 19-22, San Antonio) — $20K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Compensation & Benefits professionals — the people who control wellness budgets |
| Theme Alignment | Total rewards = salary + benefits + perks + wellness. You're a line item they manage. |
| Buyer Type | Budget holders. They sign checks. |
| Investment | Higher cost ($20K) but higher ROI potential — these are decision-makers. |

**Why it's #2:** Workhuman gets you the "culture champion." Total Rewards gets you the "budget holder." You need both.

**3. Workhuman Live (April 28-May 1, Austin) — $8K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Employee Experience, Culture, Engagement leaders — exactly who buys Shortcut |
| Theme Alignment | Conference is about human-centered workplace strategies. Wellbeing is a core track. |
| Attendee Intent | People actively investing in employee experience. Not tire-kickers. |
| Vibe | High-energy, values-driven. Matches Shortcut's brand. |

**Why it's #3:** Best audience-to-noise ratio of any national conference. Mid-size (3K) means you can actually connect.

---

### H2 CONFERENCE PLAN (JULY–DEC)

#### Objective: Budget Capture

H2 is about **re-engaging leads** from H1 and capturing budget before year-end. The goal is to:
- Convert 30%+ of H1 pipeline
- Generate 40+ new leads
- Close $150K+ in new ARR from conference-sourced leads

#### H2 Conferences

| # | Conference | Date | Location | Est. Cost | Expected Leads | Priority |
|---|------------|------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Benefits Forum & Expo | Sept 14-17 | Las Vegas | $7K | 15-25 | **#1** |

| | **H2 Total** | | | **~$36K** | **55-90** | |

#### H2 Conference Details

**1. Benefits Forum & Expo (Sept 14-17, Las Vegas) — $7K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Benefits professionals, HR leaders, brokers — all in one place |
| Timing | September — perfect for Q4 budget discussions |
| Size | 3,000+ attendees, but highly targeted audience |
| Opportunity | Re-engage H1 leads who are now finalizing budgets |

**Why it's #1 for H2:** Benefits buyers are making final decisions. This is where you close.

**2. Conference Board Fall HR (Oct 27-28, NYC) — $6K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Enterprise HR & benefits leaders focused on workforce strategy |
| Credibility | The Conference Board is blue-chip. Attendees are senior. |
| Location | NYC. Home turf again. |
| Timing | Late October — last chance for Q4 closes |

**Why it's #2:** High-quality enterprise leads. If you want bigger accounts, this is where they are.

**3. WORKTECH26 (November, NYC) — $18K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Workplace Experience, Real Estate, HR leaders — intersection of space + people |
| Theme Alignment | Future of work, hybrid workplace, employee experience — all Shortcut sweet spots |
| Investment | Higher cost but premium audience quality |
| Opportunity | Position Shortcut as the "workplace wellbeing" layer in hybrid work strategy |

**Why it's #3:** Emerging conference with high-intent audience. Worth the investment if early H2 results are strong.

**4. LinkedIn Talent Connect (Fall, TBD) — $5K**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Audience | Talent Acquisition, Employer Branding, HR leaders |
| Theme Alignment | Employer brand = benefits + culture + wellbeing. Shortcut fits. |
| Cost | Lower cost, good ROI potential |
| Opportunity | Different buyer persona — TA leaders who influence benefits decisions |

**Why it's #4:** Lower priority but high efficiency. Good for diversifying lead sources.

---

### UPGRADE & SCALE LOGIC

The conference plan is designed to **adapt based on results**:

#### If H1 Results Are Strong (50+ qualified leads, 20+ demos)
- Increase H2 budget by $5-10K
- Upgrade WORKTECH26 to premium sponsorship
- Add one additional H2 conference (e.g., HR Tech)

#### If H1 Results Are Weak (<30 leads, <10 demos)
- Reduce H2 conference spend by $10K
- Focus on smaller, higher-touch events
- Shift budget to content marketing or SDR outreach

#### Revenue Signals to Watch
| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Conference-sourced demos | 20+ in H1 | Increase H2 spend |
| Conference-sourced pipeline | $200K+ in H1 | Upgrade H2 sponsorships |
| Close rate on conference leads | >20% | Double down on same events |
| Cost per qualified lead | <$500 | Scale that conference |

---

## SECTION 5: LEVER 3 — HEALTHCARE CHANNELS

### THE OPPORTUNITY

Companies increasingly fund wellness through employer-level healthcare budgets:

- Health Improvement Funds (Cigna)
- Wellness credits/packages (Aetna, BCBS)
- Lifestyle Spending Accounts (LSAs)

**This is NOT individual HSA/FSA. This is pooled corporate money that HR can use to pay for Shortcut services.**

---

### CIGNA HEALTH IMPROVEMENT FUND — THE MODEL

#### What It Is
Company-level wellness budget provided by Cigna to employer clients. Pooled corporate money for wellness programming.

#### How It Works

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Health Engagement team meets with employer to personalize strategy and review eligible expenses |
| 2 | Employer discusses expense requests with Health Engagement team to confirm eligibility BEFORE spending |
| 3 | Employer makes purchase, submits invoices/receipts to Health Engagement team |
| 4 | Cigna reimburses the employer |

#### Key Details
- Funds available throughout plan year
- Use-it-or-lose-it — unused funds forfeited at year end
- Receipts due by end of month of purchase
- 45-60 days reimbursement processing
- Subject to local market guidelines and policy renewal

#### What's Eligible

**✅ ELIGIBLE — Shortcut Services Fit Here:**

| Cigna Category | Shortcut Service |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Activities and challenges to promote healthy living" | Wellness days, mindfulness workshops |
| "Guest speakers who discuss health and wellness topics" | Mindfulness facilitators |
| "Onsite group exercise classes (e.g. Zumba, yoga, pilates)" | Mindfulness workshops |
| "Health Awareness Day material" | Wellness event programming |

**⚠️ POSITION CAREFULLY:**
- Chair massage → Part of "wellness activities/events"
- Grooming services → Part of "Employee Appreciation Wellness Day"
- Headshots → Part of "Health Awareness Day" package

**❌ INELIGIBLE:**
- Capital expenses (equipment, furniture)
- Gifts to individual employees
- Meals for select groups

#### The Shortcut Play
Package services as "wellness events" — not standalone massage or grooming:
- "Employee Appreciation Wellness Day"
- "Health Awareness Event"
- "Stress Reduction Program"

This framing aligns with Cigna's eligible expense language.

---

### HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TARGET LIST — RANKED

| Rank | Insurer | Program Name | Company-Level Budget? | Shortcut Services Eligible? | Contact Point |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Cigna | Health Improvement Fund | ✅ Yes | ✅ Confirmed (see above) | Health Engagement Consultants |
| 2 | BCBS TX/IL/OK | Wellbeing Network | ✅ Yes | ✅ Explicitly lists massage | Regional wellness team |
| 3 | Aetna | Premier Wellness Package | ✅ Yes | ✅ Group events eligible | SupplierEngagement@CVSHealth.com |
| 4 | UnitedHealthcare | UHC Hub | ✅ Yes (self-funded) | ⚠️ Requires vendor network | UHC Hub business development |
| 5 | Anthem/Elevance | Wellbeing Solutions | ✅ Yes (tiered) | ⚠️ Preventive focus | Ariba Network registration |
| 6 | BCBS Michigan | Well-Being Programs | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Not explicit on massage | Regional contact |
| 7 | Kaiser | Fit Rewards | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Fitness focus | Lower priority |

---

### HOW TO BECOME AN APPROVED INSURER VENDOR

#### The Reality
Most wellness vendors do NOT have direct insurer contracts. Typical paths:

1. **Employer direct** — Sell to HR, they use their wellness budget ← *Fastest*
2. **Benefits broker referral** — Brokers recommend you ← *High leverage*
3. **LSA platform listing** — Employees use wellness stipends ← *Growing fast*
4. **Direct insurer vendor network** — Hardest but highest leverage ← *Long-term*

#### Direct Insurer Registration Portals

| Insurer | Portal | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Cigna | cigna.supplierone.co | Code: "CignaSupplier2". Info kept 2 years. |
| Aetna/CVS | cvshealth.supplierone.co | Email: SupplierEngagement@CVSHealth.com |
| Elevance (Anthem) | Ariba Network via elevancehealth.com | Free Ariba account required |
| UnitedHealthcare | No public portal | Contact UHC Hub team directly |
| BCBS | Varies by region | Contact regional plan |

#### Requirements to Qualify

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| General Liability Insurance | $1-2M per occurrence |
| Professional Liability (E&O) | $1M minimum |
| Workers' Comp | State-required |
| HIPAA Compliance | Documented policies |
| Background Checks | All on-site staff |
| References | 3+ similar employer clients |

---

### WHO TO TARGET WITHIN INSURERS

#### Primary Targets

| Title | Why They Matter |
|-------|-----------------|
| Health Engagement Consultant | Works directly with employer accounts. The person in Cigna's one-pager. |
| Director of Wellness Programs | Owns the wellness product offering. |
| VP of Health Engagement | Executive sponsor for wellness initiatives. |
| Vendor Relations Manager | Handles vendor onboarding and contracts. |

#### How to Find Them
LinkedIn search:
- "Health Engagement Cigna"
- "Wellness Programs Director Aetna"
- "Vendor Management UnitedHealthcare"

#### The Outreach Angle
Don't lead with "can we be a vendor?"

**Better:**
> "We work with companies like BCG, DraftKings, and Betterment to deliver on-site wellness experiences. Several of our clients are Cigna customers using their Health Improvement Fund to pay for our services. We'd love to understand how we can make it easier for Cigna employers to work with us."

Positions you as already in the ecosystem.

### BENEFITS BROKER/CONSULTANT TARGETS

| WTW | Enterprise | "Integrated Wellbeing Solution" team. |
| Aon | Enterprise | Health Solutions practice. |

#### Event to Target
**BenefitsPRO Broker Expo** — April 28-30, Chicago
- 700+ benefits brokers and advisors
- 8.5 hours dedicated networking

| Benepass | Card-first approach. Employees pay directly. |
| Compt | Employee stipend software. |
| Espresa | LSA administration with marketplace. |

## SECTION 6: LEVER 3B — CLE FOR LAWYERS

### THE OPPORTUNITY

Law firms are a natural fit:
- High stress, burnout epidemic (28% depression, 21% problem drinking — ABA data)
- Concentrated decision-making (managing partners, firm administrators)
- High willingness to pay for quality
- Already a Shortcut strength (Wachtell Lipton is a client)

---

### CLE REQUIREMENTS BY STATE

9+ states now require or accept mental health/wellness CLE credits:

| State | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Florida | 5 hours / 3 years (mandatory) |
| Illinois | 1 hour / 2 years (mandatory) |
| New York | Wellness counts toward competence credits |
| California | 1 hour "Wellness Competence" eligible |
| Texas | Counts toward ethics requirement |
| Iowa | 1 hour mandatory (wellness or D&I) |
| Oregon | 1 hour per 3-year cycle |
| Minnesota | 1 hour mandatory |
| Vermont | 1 hour mandatory |

---

### IMPORTANT: MASSAGE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR CLE

**Research conclusion:** Massage does NOT qualify for CLE credits in any US state.

States like Georgia explicitly exclude physical wellness activities:
> "The Commission may not approve CLEs primarily devoted to activities such as meditation, journaling, yoga, nutrition, physical fitness or other similar activities."

**What qualifies:** Educational content about wellness (lectures, workshops, discussions) — not receiving wellness services.

---

### THE SHORTCUT CLE PLAY

**Mindfulness workshops qualify for CLE. Massage does not.**

But you can bundle:

| Component | CLE Credit? | Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Mindfulness workshop (60-90 min) | ✅ Yes (1-1.5 credits) | Continuing education |
| Chair massage (during breaks) | ❌ No | Experiential differentiation |
| Headshots (optional) | ❌ No | Practical takeaway |

**Positioning:** "CLE-accredited wellness day — mindfulness training that counts toward CLE, plus chair massage and headshots to make it memorable."

The CLE credit gets you in the door. The services make you unforgettable.

---

### CLE PRODUCT SUITE

| Product | Format | CLE Credits | Includes | Price Point |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Mindfulness CLE Session | 60-90 min workshop | 1-1.5 | Education only | $3-5K |
| Wellness Half-Day | 3-4 hours | 2-3 | CLE + massage | $8-12K |
| Wellness Full-Day | 6 hours | 4-5 | CLE + massage + headshots | $15-20K |
| Annual Program | Quarterly sessions | 4-6/year | All services | $40-60K |

## SECTION 7: LEVER 4 — SHORTCUT-HOSTED EVENTS

### THE CONCEPT

Instead of only attending other people's conferences, we host our own. Small, curated networking events for target buyers — with Shortcut services embedded.

---

### WHY THIS WORKS

| Reason | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| We control the room | Only qualified buyers, no noise |
| Experience IS the pitch | They feel what we do, don't just hear about it |
| Lower CAC | $5K event vs $15K conference booth |
| Content engine | Photos, testimonials, relationships from every event |
| Referral flywheel | Attendees invite peers to future events |

---

### EVENT FORMAT: "THE SHORTCUT SESSIONS"

**Concept:** Quarterly evening events for HR, Workplace Experience, and People leaders in NYC. Part networking, part wellness experience, part thought leadership.

#### Run of Show (2.5-3 hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00-6:30 | Arrival, drinks, networking |
| 6:30-7:00 | Short panel or fireside chat (client + industry speaker) |
| 7:00-8:00 | Wellness stations rotate (chair massage, express manicures, headshot booth) |
| 8:00-8:30 | Open networking, dessert |

---

### WHAT MAKES IT ATTRACTIVE

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Curated guest list | Exclusivity signals quality |
| Free high-value services | Chair massage + headshots = $200+ value |
| Peer networking | HR leaders want to meet other HR leaders |
| No hard sell | Relationship building, not pitch meeting |
| Great content | Professional photos → LinkedIn gold |
| Venue choice | Cool space (rooftop, gallery) signals quality |

---
