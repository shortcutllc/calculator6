## Why Mindfulness Qualifies for Ethics CLE Credit

### The Competence Rationale
- **ABA Model Rule 1.1 (Competence)**: Lawyer must withdraw if mental/physical condition materially impairs ability
- 2017 National Task Force: wellbeing is "an indispensable part of a lawyer's duty of competence"
- Mindfulness directly addresses ethical decision-making under stress

### Ethical Decision-Making Enhancement
- Mindfulness enables "entertaining a thought without accepting it"
- Helps modulate emotions in professional contexts
- Research shows mindfulness fosters ethical behavior
- Addresses accelerated pace of modern legal practice

### Prevention of Ethical Violations
- 21-36% of lawyers are problem drinkers → substance abuse impairs competence
- Chronic stress leads to impaired judgment → affects client representation
- Mindfulness provides sustainable stress management tools

### How It Fits CLE Categories
1. **Mental Health & Substance Abuse** — most common category
2. **Professionalism & Civility** — maintaining professional demeanor
3. **General Ethics/Professional Responsibility** — competence discussion
4. **Attorney Wellness** — standalone category in some states
