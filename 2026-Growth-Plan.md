## Slide 7: Four Levers Overview

### Lever 1: Content
**Lower the education barrier for new clients**

Most prospects have never bought this category. We need to educate them on what corporate wellness actually means.

- In-Person Wellness Playbook
- Client case studies & video clips
- LinkedIn thought leadership

### Lever 2: Conferences
**Accelerate qualified leads at national + local level**

Get in front of decision-makers at scale. HR/Benefits conferences are our highest-intent channel.

- 6 conferences/year ($60K budget)
- Target HR, Benefits, Workplace Exp.
- Live demos at booth

### Lever 3: Healthcare Channels
**Unlock employer wellness dollars (Cigna, Aetna, BCBS)**

Companies fund wellness through health improvement funds, wellness packages, and LSAs. This is pooled corporate money.

- Cigna Health Improvement Fund
- Benefits broker partnerships
- LSA platform integration

### Lever 4: Hosted Events
**Build our own lead-gen machine in NYC**

Instead of only attending conferences, we host our own. Small, curated networking events with Shortcut services embedded.

- Quarterly "Shortcut Sessions"
- 40-50 qualified HR leaders per event
- $5K event vs $15K conference booth

---

## Slide 8: Content Strategy

**Happiness-First. Proof-Driven. Sales-Accelerating.**

We're selling **feel-good moments that make work better** - for employees *and* the people responsible for them.

### The Confidence Gap

Most buyers:
- Never purchased this category
- Don't know what good looks like
- Worry about effort & risk
- Unsure if employees will care

**Our content strategy exists to close this confidence gap.**

### Three Content Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Make the Happiness Visible
Buyers need to *see* the experience to believe it.
- Real events, real offices
- Real employees, real reactions
- Credible, human proof

**Outcome:** Removes imagination risk

#### Pillar 2: Make the Ease Undeniable
HR doesn't fear cost - they fear complexity.
- How little HR actually does
- How signups & execution work
- How scale happens smoothly

**Outcome:** "This feels handled"

#### Pillar 3: Make the Difference Obvious
Differentiation must be *explicit*, not implied.
- All-in-one, operationally excellent
- Consistent, scalable
- Hospitality-driven, tech-enabled

**Outcome:** Stop comparing, start choosing

### Our Voice (Non-Negotiable)

**We sound like:**
- Light, human, optimistic
- Happiness-forward
- Confident without salesy
- Simple, not corporate

**We don't sound like:**
- A benefits provider
- A wellness consultant
- A mental health platform
- Corporate or heavy

> "The easiest, happiest decision an HR or Workplace leader can make."

## Slide 9: Content Assets

### The 10 Assets That Matter Most

Anything not on this list is secondary. Goal: shorter sales cycles, faster "yes" decisions.

| # | Asset | Description | Stage | H1 Priority |
|---|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Real Event Recap Videos | 30-60 sec, iPhone fine. Visual proof of happiness. | Awareness to Decision | Yes |
| 2 | "What Happens When Shortcut Shows Up" | Photos + clips, event timeline. Remove uncertainty. | Awareness to Consideration | Yes |
| 3 | Employee Reaction Clips | "This made my day." Emotional validation. | Awareness | No |
| 4 | HR/Manager Testimonials (Ease-Focused) | "We didn't lift a finger." Risk reduction. | Consideration to Decision | Yes |
| 5 | All-in-One vs Vendor Sprawl One-Pager | One partner, one platform, one invoice. | Decision | Yes |
| 6 | "How Scaling Works" Explainer | One to multiple offices. Enterprise confidence. | Consideration to Decision | No |
| 7 | Multi-Location Case Study | BCG/DraftKings. Rollout, consistency, scale. | Decision | No |
| 8 | Signup & Admin Flow Visuals | Screenshots, recordings. Ease + tech credibility. | Consideration | Yes |
| 9 | "Why Companies Renew" Page | Retention stats, quotes. Long-term trust. | Decision | No |
| 10 | Event Experience Photo Library | Clean, categorized. Sales acceleration. | All stages | No |

### H1 2026 - Must Ship

- Event recap videos
- Visual experience page
- HR testimonials
- Vendor sprawl comparison
- Signup flow visuals

**H2:** Multi-location case study, scaling explainer, renewal proof, enterprise testimonials

### How We Measure Success

- Sales calls get shorter
- Fewer questions are asked
- Buyers say "this feels easy"
- Buyers reference content unprompted
- Time-to-yes decreases

**If content doesn't do that, it doesn't matter.**

## Slide 10: Conference Strategy

**7 conferences across the year - H1 for pipeline creation, H2 for budget capture**

### H1: Pipeline Creation (Jan-Jun)

## Slide 11: Lead Estimation Methodology

### Calculation Variables

| Variable | Assumption |
|----------|------------|
| Attendees in target persona | 30-50% of total (HR, Benefits, Workplace Exp) |
| Booth traffic rate | 10-15% of relevant attendees visit a given booth |
| Conversation-to-lead conversion | 50-70% of booth conversations = qualified lead |
| Speaking/session bonus | +20-30% leads if you have a speaking slot |

### Example: Workhuman (3,000 attendees)

- Target personas: ~60% = 1,800 relevant
- Booth traffic: 10% = 180 visits
- Qualified: 60% = ~108 leads at top end
- **Conservative (no speaking slot): 20-30 leads**

### Example: Wellbeing at Work NYC (500 attendees)

- Target personas: ~80% = 400 relevant (highly curated)
- Booth/networking capture: 15% = 60 conversations
- Qualified: 70% = ~40 leads at top end
- **Conservative: 15-25 leads**

### Lead Multipliers

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Speaking slot | +50-100% |
| Sponsored session | +30% |
| Pre-conference outreach | +20% |
| On-site activation | +25% |

## Slide 17: Conference Success Metrics

### Success Metrics Table

| Metric | H1 Target | H2 Target | Full Year |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Qualified Leads | 50-80 | 55-90 | 105-170 |
| Demos Booked | 20-30 | 25-35 | 45-65 |
| Pipeline Generated | $200K | $250K | $450K |
| Closed Revenue | -- | $100K+ | $150K+ |
| Cost per Lead | <$600 | <$600 | <$600 |
| Conference ROI | -- | -- | 3x+ |

### Scale Logic

#### If H1 Results Are Strong (50+ qualified leads, 20+ demos)

- Increase H2 budget by $5-10K
- Upgrade WORKTECH26 to premium sponsorship
- Add one additional H2 conference (e.g., HR Tech)

#### If H1 Results Are Weak (<30 leads, <10 demos)

- Reduce H2 conference spend by $10K
- Focus on smaller, higher-touch events
- Shift budget to content marketing or SDR outreach

### Revenue Signals to Watch

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Conference demos | 20+ in H1 | Increase H2 spend |
| Pipeline | $200K+ in H1 | Upgrade sponsorships |
| Close rate | >20% | Double down same events |
| Cost per lead | <$500 | Scale that conference |

## Slide 18: Employer Wellness Funds

### ALREADY VALIDATED — This Is Real Revenue

**Proven channel — clients have already used Cigna and Aetna funds to pay for Shortcut services**

Corporate partners have successfully used Cigna and Aetna wellness funds to pay for massage and mindfulness events. Funds expire at plan year-end — use-it-or-lose-it urgency.

### Current Services — PROVEN ELIGIBLE

| Service | Cigna Category | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| 💆 Chair & Table Massage | "Onsite group exercise classes" | ✅ Clients already using |
| 🧘 Mindfulness Workshops | "Guest speakers on wellness topics" | ✅ Clients already using |

### New Services to Add (Q2 Launch Target)

| Service | Cigna Category | Priority |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| 🧘‍♀️ Onsite Yoga Classes | "Onsite group exercise classes (yoga, pilates)" | HIGH |
| 🤸 Assisted Stretch / Recovery | "Activities to promote healthy living" | HIGH |
| 🥗 Nutrition Workshops | "Guest speakers (nutrition, behavioral health)" | MED |

### Other Eligible Services Worth Exploring

- Flu Shot Clinics
- Biometric Screenings
- CPR/First Aid Training
- Financial Wellness Speakers
- Ergonomic Assessments

### Provider Validation Status

| Provider | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Cigna | ✅ USING |
| Aetna | ✅ USING |
| Anthem | 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY |
| BCBS | 🔍 Q1 Research |
| UHC | 🔍 Q1 Research |

**KEY: Unused funds EXPIRE at plan year-end — HR has urgency to spend**

---

## Slide 19: How It Works

**Company-level funds for group wellness events — not individual employee spending**

### The Reimbursement Flow

1. **HR books Shortcut** → Group wellness day for the office
2. **Shortcut invoices company** → B2B transaction, company pays us
3. **Company submits to insurer** → Invoice + receipts to Health Engagement team
4. **Insurer reimburses company** → 45-60 days processing

### This IS Our Model

- **Company-level decision** — HR/benefits team books us
- **Group service delivery** — massage day for the office
- **B2B invoice** — we bill the company directly
- **Pooled corporate funds** — not individual employee accounts
- **Massage is eligible** — confirmed as qualifying wellness activity

### This is NOT Our Model

- Individual employee LSA/HSA/FSA spending
- Employees browsing a marketplace to book
- Per-employee reimbursement or cards
- Consumer-facing transactions

**Why This Matters:** LSA platforms like Forma and Benepass are for individual employee spending — not relevant to our B2B model. Our focus: help companies access their **insurer wellness funds** and connect with **benefits brokers** who recommend vendors.

---

## Slide 20: Benefits Broker Channel

---

## Slide 24: The Shortcut Sessions

**Q1: Design the experience. Q2-Q4: Launch 3 unforgettable events.**

### 2026 Event Timeline

| Quarter | Phase | Event | Timing |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Q1** | DESIGN | Finalize concept, secure sponsors, build invite list | Jan-Mar |
| **Q2** | EVENT #1 | "Summer Ready" - Rooftop venue + drinks | Late May/Early June |
| **Q3** | EVENT #2 | "The Recharge" - Wine tasting + wellness | Mid-September |
| **Q4** | EVENT #3 | "The Thank You" - Holiday cocktails | Early November |

### Q1 Design Phase Checklist

- Finalize event concept & brand
- Scout venue partners (trade services for space)
- Secure 2-3 sponsors (beverage, co-host, content)
- Build invite list (200+ qualified targets)
- Design registration flow

### Event Format (2.5-3 hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 6:00-6:30 | 🍸 Arrival, signature cocktails, networking |
| 6:30-7:00 | 🎤 20-min panel or fireside chat |
| 7:00-8:00 | 💆 Wellness stations (massage, nails, headshots) |
| 8:00-8:30 | 🍰 Dessert, open networking, soft close |

### Sponsor & Partner Strategy

| Partner Type | Role | Benefit |
|--------------|------|---------|
| **Venue Partner** | Trade services for space | WeWork, Convene, hotel rooftops |
| **Beverage Sponsor** | $1-2K to cover drinks | Wine brand, spirits company |
| **Co-Host Partner** | Complementary HR tech | Benefits platform, HRIS |
| **Content Partner** | Amplification | HR media outlet |

**Goal: Reduce event cost to $2-3K net**

### Event Economics (per event)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gross cost | $4-6K |
| Attendees | 40-60 |
| New clients | 3-5 |

**3 events × 4 clients × $12K avg = $144K pipeline**

### Why This Works

- ✓ We control the room
- ✓ Experience IS the pitch
- ✓ Lower CAC than conferences
- ✓ Content engine (photos, video)
- ✓ Referral flywheel
- ✓ Sponsors offset costs

**Invite strategy:** "You're invited because you're a senior HR leader at a company we admire" — exclusivity + free $200+ wellness services + peer networking + drinks = 60%+ attendance rate

---

## Slide 25: Sample Invitation

**Subject:** You're invited: An evening for HR leaders who actually care about their people

---

[Name],

We're hosting a small gathering of senior HR and Workplace Experience leaders in NYC - **40 people, max**.

The evening includes:

- A 20-minute conversation with [Client Name] on what's actually working in employee wellness
- Complimentary chair massage, professional headshots, and express manicures
- Good drinks, good food, and a room full of people who get it

**No pitch. No PowerPoints. Just an evening designed the way we think work should feel.**

**[Date] | 6-8:30pm | [Venue]**

Space is limited. Let me know if you'd like to join.

-- Will

## Slide 26: Client Entertainment

**Beyond Employee Wellness — Help firms impress their clients with unforgettable experiences**

### The Opportunity

**Problem with Traditional Client Entertainment:**
- Golf outings and steak dinners are tired, expected, forgettable
- Experiential purchases create stronger memories than material ones
- High-net-worth clients value access, trust, and values alignment
- Everyone's doing the same thing — no differentiation

**The Shortcut Opportunity:**
- Same services, new buyer (BD/Events vs HR)
- Higher ACV: $10-25K events vs $2-5K wellness days
- Differentiated: "The client entertainment that actually gets remembered"
- Existing relationships: Warm intros from HR to Events teams

### Target Accounts: Wall Street & Professional Services

| Tier | Examples | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| Investment Banks | Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan | Deal celebrations, investor days |
| PE & Hedge Funds | Blackstone, KKR, Citadel | LP meetings, annual events |
| Wealth Management | UBS, Merrill, Rockefeller | Client appreciation |
| Law & Consulting | Wachtell, BCG (existing!) | Client entertainment |

### Client Entertainment Packages

| Package | Description | Price |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **"The Closer"** — Deal Celebration | Private venue, massage stations, headshots, champagne | $15-25K |
| **"The LP Experience"** — Investor Day | Morning wellness lounge, afternoon stations, evening cocktails | $20-40K |
| **"The Cultivator"** — Prospect Entertainment | Intimate 12-20 person wellness dinner experience | $8-15K |

### 2026 Timeline

- **Q1:** Design packages, create landing page, pilot with existing clients (Wachtell, BCG)
- **Q2:** Launch first client entertainment event, build case study
- **Q3-Q4:** Outbound to Wall Street targets, scale based on Q2 learnings

### Revenue Potential

| Scenario | Math | Revenue |
|----------|------|---------|
| Conservative | 5 clients × $15K × 2 events | $150K |
| **Moderate** | **15 clients × $18K × 3 events** | **$810K** |
| Aggressive | 30 clients × $20K × 4 events | $2.4M |

**Could be $500K-$1M+ vertical by 2027**
